# ðŸ§  PLC Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of PLC projects! This space is dedicated to showcasing automation logic and simulations developed using TwinCAT 3 and Structured Text (ST). Each project highlights a different aspect of control systems engineering. Due to the size of each project, I have created links to each project. Follow the links to gain access to each sample project.

## ðŸ”— Project Index

| Project | Description | Link |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **Control Panel Sequencer** | Simulates the startup and shutdown sequence of an industrial control panel using a finite state machine for step management. | [View Repo]([https://github.com/Yasteer/PID-Tank-Pressure-Control.git](https://github.com/Yasteer/Control-Panel-Startup-Shutdown-Sequencer.git) |
| **Tank Pressure Control** | Simulates a tank with an input control valve managed by a PID controller to maintain a pressure of 200 kPa, assuming a constant drop of 5 kPa. | [View Repo](https://github.com/Yasteer/PID-Tank-Pressure-Control.git) |
