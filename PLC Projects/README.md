# ðŸ§  PLC Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of PLC projects! This space is dedicated to showcasing automation logic and simulations developed using TwinCAT 3 and Structured Text (ST). Each project highlights a different aspect of control systems engineering. Due to the size of each project, I have created links to each project. Follow the links to gain access to each sample project.

## ðŸ“‚ How to Use

1. Follow each link to its unique repository.
2. Every repository has a README.md file below the folder structure with a summary of the project.
3. There is also an archive of each project with the file type .tnzip that holds a compressed version of the whole project should you wish to examine the source code.
