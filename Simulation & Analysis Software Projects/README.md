# 🧪 Simulation & Analysis Projects

This folder contains a collection of platform-independent projects focused on simulation, algorithm development, and theoretical analysis. These projects are typically developed using software tools such as **MATLAB**, **Simulink**, **Python**, and **C++**, and are not tied to any specific hardware platform.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of these projects is to demonstrate my ability to:
- Model and simulate real-world electrical and control systems
- Analyze circuit behavior using numerical methods
- Develop algorithms for system control or signal processing
- Visualize and interpret simulation results

## 🧰 Tools & Languages

- MATLAB / Simulink
- C / C++
- Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Octave (where applicable)

## 📂 Project Structure

Each project has its own subfolder, and includes:
- 💻 Source Code
- 📊 Simulation results or plots
- 📝 A short write-up or theoretical explanation in `README.md`

## 🚀 Example Topics

- Transient response analysis of RLC circuits  
- Frequency domain analysis using FFT  
- PID controller simulations  
- Power electronics modeling (e.g., buck/boost converter behavior)  
- Root locus, Bode plot, and pole-zero analysis
